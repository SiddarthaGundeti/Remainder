# Remainder

Write a program that reads a dividend and a divisor, calculates the remainder, and then prints the remainder.

Input: 7
       2

Output: 1

Explanation:

remainder = dividend - (divisor * quotient)

remainder = 7 - (2 * 3)

remainder = 7 - 6

remainder = 1

Step 2: Reading the Input
To read the values, we use input() and convert them to integers using int().

Step 3: Calculating the Quotient and Remainder
We calculate the quotient and remainder using the formula provided in the question.

Step 4: Printing the Result
We use the print() function to display the remainder on the screen.

Step 5: Putting it all together
Here's the complete code:
That's it! You can now use this program to calculate the remainder of any dividend and divisor.
